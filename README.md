# everyitemchallenge
A challenge made with Da Rules mod. Note that items will only be changed if they were in the room when you spawned in. Use the drop key to convert other pedestals into the proper item.
Simply place this folder into your mods folder and then it will show up in your custom challenges tab. From there you can press "J" and then "save preset" if you don't want it as a challenge. Requires the Da Rules mod.
